Match Two
=========

A work-in-progress iPad app dedicated for my mom. 
It is based on [Cocos2d framework](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-iphone).

The gameplay itself is very simple. Find two tiles with matching visual that can be linked with a line of three turns or less, and they can be removed from the board.

Upcoming features
-----------------
-	A level up system
-	Special ability when certain tiles are disolved.

Right now it's only localized in Chinese.
